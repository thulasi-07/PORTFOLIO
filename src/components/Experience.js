        'During my one-month internship (Oct 28 – Nov 28, 2024) at Vinyasa Tech Solutions, I focused on front-end development using React. I gained hands-on experience in building responsive UIs and understanding the full web development lifecycle. As part of a team, I worked on recreating the Myntra homepage UI using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. Additionally, I developed a To-Do List App independently in React and Tailwind CSS, strengthening my skills in component-based architecture, state management, and clean UI design.',
